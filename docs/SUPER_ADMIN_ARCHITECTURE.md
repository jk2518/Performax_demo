## 🔒 Security & Data Boundaries
- Super Admin has zero data isolation restrictions (can view and mutate records across all departments and teams).
- Every write action performed by Super Admin generates an immutable record in `AuditLog`.
- Super Admin can impersonate/re-evaluate appraisals and override locked states if necessary.
